This example demonstrates the basic use of GPULib from within IDL.

The program creates a vector of nx random numbers on the CPU.
In the first test, it then computes the LGAMMA function of this vector
niter+1 times. 

Next it puts the original test vector onto the GPU and computes niter+1 
times the LGAMMA function on the GPU and finally gets the result back to
the host memory.

In both cases, the elapsed time is recorded and finally reported.
